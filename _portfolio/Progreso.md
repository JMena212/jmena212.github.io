## Explanation

When dealing with various projects for several clients simultaneously, keeping everyone up-to-date on progress can become an administrative burden. Progreso is designed to help making project updates easier and more easily digestible.

## Problem

The problem we are addressing is simple. How do we find a balance between communicating project progress and not overloading clients or colleagues with information and unnecessary emails?

## Solution

The solution provided by Progreso is to create updates with text notes, images, and file uploads that quickly summarize the latest status update for a project. The update is then shared via text using a Twilio API. This keeps updates, short, sweet and easily digestible and simplifies communication.

## Results

Results forthcoming

## Conclusion

Progreso is phenomenal
