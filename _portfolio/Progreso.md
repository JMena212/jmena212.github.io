## Explanation

When dealing with various projects for several clients simultaneously, keeping the right people up-to-date on progress can become an administrative burden. Progreso is a project management tool designed to streamline this process.

## Problem

The problem we are addressing is this: Where is the balance between communicating project progress and not overloading clients/colleagues with information and unnecessary emails? And how can we quickly share files/media/text updates without writing long emails with attachments?


## Solution

The solution provided by Progreso is to create updates with text notes, images, and file uploads that quickly summarize the latest status update for a project. The update is then shared via text using a Twilio API. This keeps updates, short, sweet and easily digestible.  

## Results

Progreso has worked well in limited testing done by my Bloc Mentor, close friends, and I. 

## Conclusion

Although various project management applications already exist, the simplicity of Progreso's user interface and integration with SMS makes it a viable project management solution and reliable alternative.
Next steps include tweaking the user view that launches upon clicking on the mobile link and creating a mobile app for iOS/Android.
